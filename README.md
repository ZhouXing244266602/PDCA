# PDCA

PDCA system

PDCA is the English word Plan (Plan), Do (execution), Check (check) and the Action (action) is the first letter, PDCA cycle is in accordance with this order for quality management, and the cycle than to carry on the scientific program. 1, P (plan) plan, including determining policy and objectives, and the development of planned activities. PDCA PDCA ring ring (2) 2, D (Do) execution, based on known information, designed specifically, programs and plans layout; then according to the design and layout, specific operation, to achieve the planned content. 3, C (check) inspection, review the results of the implementation plan, which distinguish between right and what is wrong, a clear effect, identify the problem. 4, A (action) to summarize the results of checks processed, to be sure of successful experiences and to be standardized; for failures also summarized attention. For unresolved issues should be submitted to the next PDCA cycle to resolve. These four processes are not run once on the end, but the cycle progresses, a cycle is over, to solve some problems, not solve the problem into the next cycle, so stepped rising. PDCA cycle is a total quality management should follow scientific procedures.

This is a Java version of the PDCA system, used in the Spring and Mybaits framework, ViEW layer is JSP

PDCA系统 

PDCA是英语单词Plan(计划)、Do(执行)、Check(检查)和Action(行动)的第一个字母，PDCA循环就是按照这样的顺序进行质量管理，并且循环不止地进行下去的科学程序。
1、P (plan) 计划，包括方针和目标的确定，以及活动规划的制定。

2、D (Do) 执行，根据已知的信息，设计具体的方法、方案和计划布局；再根据设计和布局，进行具体运作，实现计划中的内容。
3、C (check) 检查，总结执行计划的结果，分清哪些对了，哪些错了，明确效果，找出问题。
4、A (action)对总结检查的结果进行处理，对成功的经验加以肯定，并予以标准化；对于失败的教训也要总结，引起重视。对于没有解决的问题，应提交给下一个PDCA循环中去解决。
以上四个过程不是运行一次就结束，而是周而复始的进行，一个循环完了，解决一些问题，未解决的问题进入下一个循环，这样阶梯式上升的。
PDCA循环是全面质量管理所应遵循的科学程序。
